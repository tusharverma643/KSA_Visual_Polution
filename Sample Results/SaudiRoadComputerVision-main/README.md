# Detection and evaluation of various elements in street imagery taken from a moving vehicle

Since visual pollution is a relatively recent issue compared to other forms of environmental contamination, study is needed to define, formalize, measure, and evaluate it from many angles. This project aims to establish a new field of automated visual pollution classification, utilizing the technological prowess of the twenty-first century for environmental management applications. Additionally this will be useful for the development of a "visual pollution score/index" for urban areas that might produce a new "metric" or "indicator" in the discipline of urban environmental management. In this project, I have built and optimized algorithms based on a large-scale dataset. This dataset features the raw sensor camera inputs as perceived by a fleet of multiple vehicles in a restricted geographic area in KSA.

● GARBAGE

● CONSTRUCTION ROAD

● BROKEN_SIGNAGE
